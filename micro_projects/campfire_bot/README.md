# campfire_bot *(Ruby)*

### Description

Campfire bot is a bot I started writing for 37signals's Campfire application during summer 2008. It is mostly finished, but as I lost access to Campfire after my summer internship ended I ceased to complete it to the level I'd have liked.

### Running it

Modify credentials, then
`ruby camptest.rb`
